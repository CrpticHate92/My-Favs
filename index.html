    <h1>My Favourite Things!</h1>

    <p>
      I will be showing you three of my favourite things, as well as give a
      reason as to why they are my favourites.

    <h2>
      My Favourite Game:<a
        href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-switch/"

    <p>
      Breath Of The Wild, has been my favourite game for quite some time, and
      will probably continue to be for some time. It is an open world game, that
      lets you do what you want to do. You can get the strongest armor and
      tools, or fight the final boss with nothing but a stick and your
      underwear. You can also challange yourself with the many shrines and
      puzzles, and if you're truly insane, you can try and collect all 999 korok
      seeds. If you find the game to easy, you can always try the master mode.
      It makes the enemies even stronger, but also adds more loot to grab. The
      modding community is also huge, they make the usually impossible possible.
      You can do so much with this game, and more.
    </p>

    <h2>
      My Favourite Movie:<a
        href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/"
        target="_blank"
        >The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</a
      >.
    </h2 class="h2">

    <p>
      Lord Of The Rings, is one my favourite book series, along with other
      fantasy fiction. When I found out they were made into movies, I was so
      happy. The design of everything was amazing, the cast was perfect, and it
      followed the story really well. It was a long binge to watch them all, but
      was very worth it. It makes you imagine all these fantasy like things,
      that you wish were real. The highest score the three movies got on Rotton
      Tomatoes, was 95% and an audience score of 95%. It also got a IMDb rating
      of 8.8/10. My favourite genre is fantasy, and this trilogy perfectly fits
      it.

    <h2 class="h20">
      My Favourite Sport:<a href="https://www.mlb.com/" target="_blank"
        >Baseball</a
      >.
    </h2>

    <p>
      I've been playing baseball for 12 years, and I have enjoyed it for so
      long. It is an easy sport to pick up from a young age, and as you get
      older the it challanges you more. It's not a brains over brawns and vice
      versa, it challanges every skill you have. You need to have good stamina,
      good upperbody for throwing and hitting, and lower body for all the
      running. You also need the right mentality, thinking 5 steps ahead to make
      a proper play. There are 9 different possitions you can play. 6 infield,
      and 3 outfield. If you have a cannon of an arm, you are best suited for
      the outfield. If you're quick on your feet, but have a weaker arm, Infield
      is better. In my personal oppinion, It's the best sport but not everyone
      will like it.
